        "answer": "Oddle's Restaurant Loyalty CRM System is a seamless, easy-to-use digital loyalty software that rewards returning customers and simplifies diner engagement. By combining simple check-in rewards with customer insights, it helps restaurants build stronger relationships and boost repeat visits."
      },
      "1": {
        "question": "How does Oddle's loyalty rewards programme work?",
        "answer": "Unlike traditional points-based programmes, Oddle uses a simple check-in system where customers earn rewards just by visiting again. All diners at the table can check in—not just the payer—resulting in up to 4x more data captured. This data is invaluable for your remarketing efforts, enabling you to better understand diner behavior and craft personalized campaigns that drive engagement. With return vouchers and flexible incentives, the programme focuses on making loyalty easy for both customers and merchants. Diners can simply tap or scan to check in, making the process fast and frictionless."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "What are some examples of Oddle merchants using this loyalty programme?",
        "answer": "In Singapore, well-known establishments like Swee Choon, Barrio, Cenzo, and HJH Maimunah use Oddle's restaurant loyalty system to attract loyal customers and increase engagement through personalized return incentives. In Malaysia, popular spots like Flaaah The Bakery and Naj & Belle leverage Oddle's check-in rewards to encourage repeat visits and reward their diners without the hassle of traditional points systems."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "Why is Oddle Loyalty the best rewards programme for restaurants?",
        "answer": "Oddle's innovative loyalty solution eliminates the complexity of traditional points-based rewards. Instead, it focuses on encouraging repeat visits through easy-to-implement check-in rewards. With Oddle's check-in solution, everyone at the table can check in—not just the payer—capturing the dining experience for all guests. This addresses one of the biggest flaws in traditional loyalty programmes that only reward the bill payer. Paired with Oddle Pass, the loyalty experience is even more seamless, offering customers and merchants a highly integrated solution."
      },

        "question": "How does Oddle's Loyalty & CRM system help restaurants better understand their customers?",

Once data is collected, Oddle's marketing engine enables you to reach your customers with targeted campaigns, helping to drive repeat visits and boost engagement."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "Is Oddle suitable for independent restaurants as well as large chains?",
        "answer": "Yes! Oddle's loyalty rewards programme for restaurants is fully scalable and works for businesses of all sizes. Whether you run a single café or a multi-location chain, Oddle provides the flexibility to design loyalty campaigns that resonate with your audience."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "What makes Oddle's Loyalty Rewards Programme different?",
